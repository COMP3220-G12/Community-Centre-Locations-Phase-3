# Community-Centre-Locations

COMP-3220 Group Project Phase 3 (Elaboration Iteration 2)

This repository contains the code that loads data from a `.csv` file downloaded from the City of Windsor's open dataset about Community Centre locations.
Once the data is loaded, it is displayed and can be accessed for different applications.

One application implemented in this repository is asking the user to enter a location (latitude and longitude) and finding the nearest community centres (5km or less).

Another application is displaying individual records of the data (first, last, next, or previous) and also sorting them by any field in the dataset.

The distance calculated is the straight-line distance between the pairs of latitude and longitude points.
A list of the nearest community centres is then displayed to the user.

This repository is an enhancement of the previous phase product (https://github.com/COMP3220-G12/Community-Centre-Locations) so that the code can be easily adaptable to load and interact with several different types of datasets.

The documentation repository for this repository can be found at: http://www.noor112.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/community-centres-dataset-2/
